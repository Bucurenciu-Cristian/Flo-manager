- Added global `processed_count` variable at module level in `extract_sessions.py` to track number of processed clients across the script.
- Declared `global processed_count` inside `extract_client_sessions` so the summary print in the `__main__` block has access to the correct value.
- Updated green cell parsing in `extract_sessions.py` to detect numeric-only text and ignore it; only non-numeric strings are now kept for the `extra` list.
